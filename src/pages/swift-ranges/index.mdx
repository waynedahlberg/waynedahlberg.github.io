Ranges are generic Swift Structures for selecting a range, or a limited subset, of an existing type. Ranges are used commonly for identifying elements between the lowest and highest values in a set.

## Kinds of Ranges

Swift gives us two ways of creating ranges. Half-Open range, and Closed Range.

### Half-Open Range

The _Half-Open_ range operator is declared with `..<` between a numeric pair.
Using a `Range` instance, you can quickly check to see if a value is contained in a particular range of values. This creates a range up to but **not** including the upper bound value.

```Swift
let underFive = 0.0..<5.0
underFive.contains(3.14) // true
underFive.contains(6.28) // false
underFive.contains(5.0) // false (upper bound value not included)
```

Range instances can represent an empty interval, unlike _Closed Range_(see below.)

```Swift
let empty = 0.0..<0.0
empty.contains(0.0) // false
empty.isEmpty // true
```

_Range_ can also be used to specify a collection of consecutive, _strideable_ values, usually Integers. It can also be used in `for-in` loops or with any sequence or collection method. The results of the range include all values up to, but **not** including the upperBound.

```Swift
for n in 3..<5 {
  print(n)
}
// prints "3"
// prints "4"
// does NOT print "5"
```

Ranges help in _Switch_ statements, using them for your cases. Consider the following:

```Swift
let score = 92

switch score {
  case 0..<50:
    print("Fail")
  case 50..<90:
    print("Pass")
  default:
    print("Excellent")
} // prints "Excellent"
```

### Closed Range

A _Closed_ range operator is declared with `...` between a pair of numeric values. The left value being the `lowerBound` and the right value being `upperBound`. The Closed Range **includes** the upperBound value.

```Swift
let range : ClosedRange = 0...5
print(range) // 0...5
print(range.first) // Optional(0)
print(range.last) // Optional(10)

for index in range {
  print(index) // prints consecutivly, values from 0 to 5
}
```

### Inspecting a Range

Here are just a few of the operations you can call on a range instance in Swift. There are many more in [Apple's Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/Range) for Range.

```Swift
var isEmpty: Bool
```

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the range contains **no** elements.

```Swift
var count: Int
```

Returns the number of elements in the collection of values.

```Swift
let lowerBound: Bound
```

Returns the range's lower bound

```Swift
let upperBound: Bound
```

Returns the range's upper bound

That's it for this quick post. See you in the next one.

This blog is a long time coming. The rise of social media has largely replaced the desire for self-publishing on the web. This is my attempt to recapture that desire, build my writing skills, and possibly share some things with others. I've noticed friends and peers firing up their own blogging engines lately. So with this post I am turning the ignition to **START**.

<!--more-->

Creating this blog presented an opporunity to build it myself instead of rely on bloated solutions like Wordpress, or walled gardens like Medium. It had to be built with simple, extensible tools that allow me to focus on content and presentation.

### Details

**Development**: Built using [Next.js](https://nexjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

**Deployment**: Updated via Github Pages. CI deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

**Content**: Created in Figma, Xcode and [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). Git pushed via [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com).

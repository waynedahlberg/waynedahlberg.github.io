This blog is a long time coming. Like many others, the rise of social media in the last decade had all but squashed my desire for self-publishing. This is my attempt to recapture that desire, and any lingering writing skills and habits. Numerous friends and peers have also revved up their blogging engines, and so with this post I symbolically turn the ignition to **_â€”STARTâ€”_**.

I have played around a bit with [Tailwind CSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com) on a few side projects. I knew I wanted it for that clean look and feel. Plus, I love the way [Adam](https://twitter.com/adamwathan) and [Steve](https://twitter.com/steveschoger) think. If you're looking to step up your design skills check out their book, [_RefactoringUI_](https://refactoringui.com/). This book enjoys a place on my shelf right next to Norman's [_Design of Everyday Things_](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654). It's that good.

Next up was which stack to use because Wordpress is on my do-not-fly list. I consulted a friend on thier Django/Python blog setup, but felt like I needed something different, or at least maintainable for _me_. Static site generation with Jekyll or Gatsby is very interesting. I went down that road and started learning more about obfuscations of react than necessary to for a simple, but extensible blog.

Long story not-so-long, I found [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). Integration with Tailwind CSS was straightforward. Posts are simply created in markdown and statically rendered and pre-loaded for lightning speed. In addition to markdown, I'm still able to learn more about and integrate custom react components within the markdown syntax. Something that was missing in other explorations.

This blog is served up via continuous integration on the [Vercel](https://vercel.com) deployment platform. Git pushes trigger re-rendering and serving automatically. I have a lot more to learn here, but so far I'm a big fan.

Okay. So everything is up and running and I'm able to compose, save .md, commit and push blog posts from my laptop. I wondered if I could do the same on the go with an iOS / iPadOS setup?. Turns out you can with a few paid apps.

First, I compose the posts in a great app called [IA Writer](http://google.com). From there, I import the markdown output into a Git manager for iPad called [Working Copy](http://google.com). I duplicate a previous post, modify the meta data for title, date and a few other housekeeping details.

Another great thing about Next.js is that it allows for embedding fully modern, extensible components into your blog posts, all while retaining the ease and simplicity of importing markdown.

Obligatory first post out of the way... See you next time.

This evening I unboxed the Hydrodomes (inner, outer, and support rings) from GraniteEarth.com.

These parts are laser-cut. They have significant burring, and will need to be first on the to-do list. I’ll need to secure a set of sand paper grits, steel wool, and Brillo pads to clean up the edges all around. Luckily I have some [NEVR-DULL polish](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Eagle-One-Nevr-Dull-5-oz./15125758) from when I cleaned up the pipes on my Triumph. This little droid is going to SHINE.

Here’s a few photos:

I’ve been very interested in 3d printing lately. The R2 Radar Eye is on the top of my list as a 3d printed part candidate.

I sent the file to [Jason Hillman](https://www.instagram.com/hillmanjason/), a coworker’s brother who built his own delta 3d printer. He graciously accepted the challenge and set up a web cam that I could check on the progress of the 14 hour print. The curvature of the dome fits the print curvature exactly. Thank you, Jason! Next steps for the Radar Eye are bondo, lots of sanding, a base primer for metallics, and the secret sauce blue dome paint.

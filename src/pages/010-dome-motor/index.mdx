Today the Pittman drive motor showed up. It’s 24/12 VDC with a 19.7:1 gear ratio. It’s high torque, high speed, and going to do a great job spinning R2’s head around in circles. I’ll stash it away until I’m able to source a CS:R frame, which from the sound of it will be this fall.

Last week these beautiful holoprojectors showed up. They are run by [BobC on the Astromech forum](<http://astromech.net/forums/showthread.php?24378-Holo-Projectors-amp-Mount-Control-System-BC-Approved-Various-(Sep-2015)-Open>). I’m slowly learning that building a droid is an extreme act of patience. What I thought was a very long time, is actually a pretty fast turnaround time for these expertly crafted products.

Very excited to get these put into the dome. They came with their own control mounting hardware, but lately I’ve seen some solutions that allow the projectors to be twisted a full 360° and beyond, and pulled to one side or the other. Very handy if you have children that can’t keep their hands to themselves. I’ll do some more research to find out the best way to mount the servo motors.

These things are beautiful. I can’t get over the fine craftsmanship, tight tolerances, and sheer amount of work that Bob put into these parts. Next update should have a more shiny dome. I’ve decided to go with the chrome, highly polished look because I don’t want it to blend in with all the other droids at a meet up.

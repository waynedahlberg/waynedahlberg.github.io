The WWDC19 Keynote is just moments away. WWDC has become increasingly important to me the last few years. This is the last opportunity I'll have to catalog my thoughts before major and minor changes alter the landscape I find myself in daily. Here goes...

- **Drag & Drop** - I want to know the implications marzipan migration has on the current D&D APIs. Drag and drop is a major component of several projects I have been working on the last 6 months. Are they going to make the API more accessible, intuitive, or add major functionality?
- **AppKit** - I've only tried my hand at macOS dev a handful of times, but have many friends who are dyed-in-the-wool mac junkies still cranking out flawless objc code. I'm more curious about the future of mac dev from their perspective. I'm also wondering how past may be prologue; AppKit being the Carbon to Marzipan's Cocoa and so forth.
- **New Mac Pro** - Modular, beefy, professional. Apple's misfire on the trashcan design was a hard lesson. I'm hoping for either a tower or a large desktop box similar to SGI's and Sun Sparcstation's of yester-decade. Modular, rack-mountable, room for massive GPUs, partnerships with NVidia... One can dream.
- **ARKit** - Apple seem to be hiring like crazy in the AR department. The current applications are cool, and make for impressive technology demos, but like VR, I just don't see myself relaxing and blowing off steam in an augmented reality environment. I think if Apple releases the touted AR glasses, it might be more enterprise-driven than consumer. I'm doubtful that the iPhone moment of 2007 will ever be replicated.
- **HIG** - I'm always looking for additions and edits to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. Last year there were many more design-focused sessions than in years past. I hope that continues, and would like to see more sessions like WWDC18's 'Designing Fluid Interfaces'. More designers need to think of interfaces in this way.
- **Dark Mode** - This could be a headache for developers. Depending on the amount of refactoring required by app devs, the adoption rate may be slow at first. I think Dark Mode will be so integral into the operating systems of iOS, macOS.
- **Xcode** - I think we'll see new tools available to developers looking to migrate iOS to macOS with minimal effort.
- **APIs** - I'll be looking at the diffs in current vs. beta documentation. Specific areas of interest to me are CollectionViews, TableViews, drag & drop (as mentioned above), haptics, UIViewPropertyAnimator, Codable, any higher-level Metal APIs.
- **The Unknown** - I'm always hoping for a 'One more thing...' moment, but I'm sure there are things I'm not even thinking about that will totally consume me. (Imagine a total overhaul of the Photos api)

One hour to go. My good friend and coworker, Tom Brinton (@brintown) is there in San Jose. We're both super excited about how the new capabilities can take both our daily work at Chatbooks, and our personal projects like games & apps â€” to the next level.

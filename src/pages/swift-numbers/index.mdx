Numbers are everywhere. They come in many different flavors. Currency, dates, scientific, etc. Computers are excellent and reading and interpreting the way numbers are expressed, humans less so. That's why we need to take the numbers that a computer understands and package them up in a way that makes sense to an average user.

## Presention

The simplest way of representing a readable number is by using a `String`.

```Swift
let x = "5"
let y = "5.11"
let z = "\(5), \(5.11)"
```

Okay, that works but it's not very usable. We need a more full-featured approach dealing with numbers we can control. Let's define a `Capacity` type that lets create a `Double` with a name, which we can present as a `description`.

```Swift
struct Capacity: Codable {
  var name: String
  var value: Double
}

extension Capacity: CustomStringConvertbile {
  var description: String {
    "\(name): \(value)"
  }
}
```

Now we're getting somewhere. But we still need to use the `Double` in a way that is more presentable. We need the decimal for precision, but we need a cutoff. Let's use 2 decimal places.

```Swift
extension Capacity: CustomStringConvertbile {
  var description: String {
    let formattedValue = String(format: "%.2f", value)
    return "\(name): \(formattedValue)"
  }
}
```

This will always output 2 decimal places, even when the value is 2.00. Again, we can dive a little deeper with `NumberFormatter`.

### NumberFormatter

Let's format our number to show decimals when it has a decimal value, and remove the "." and trailing "00" when it's a whole number equivalent. `NumberFormatter` allows us to present a decimal with a max number of trailing digits. This will give us `81`, `81.8`, and `81.83` presented just like that. The precision level will included the necessary trailing digits up to a given maximum, and then simply rounded off.

```Swift
extension Capacity: CustomStringConvertbile {
  var description: String
    let formatter = NumberFormatter()
    formatter.numberStyle = .decimal
    formatter.maximumFractionDigits = 2

    let number = NSNumber(value: value)
    let formattedValue = formatter.string(from: number)!
    return "\(name) : \(formattedValue)"
}
```

When using `NumberFormatter` you can take into account the user's `Locale` in order to present numbers with more context. In the US, we see the number `12345.67` while the same number viewed on a device in Europe will look like `12 345,67`. Other locales may present it as `12,345.67`. We get all that beautiful regional formatting for free when using `NumberFormatter`.

### Domain specificity

Depending on our needs, we'll need to deal with _domain-specific_ that hold additional features. If we're working on a Restaurant application and dealing with `Double`, we can wrap the value in a `Price` struct to better describe the cost of items on the menu.

```Swift
struct MenuItem: Codable {
  var name: String
  var price: Price
}

struct Price: Codable {
  var amount: Double
  var currency: Currency
}

enum Currency: String, Codable {
  case eur
  case usd
  case mx
  case cad
}

extension Price: CustomStringConvertbile {
  var description: String {
    let formatter = NumberFormatter()
    formatter.numberStyle = .currency
    formatter.currencyCode = currency.rawValue
    formatter.maximumFractionDigits = 2

    let number = NSNumber(value: amount)
    return formatter.string(from: number)!
  }
}
```

With the above `Price` type fully defined, let's look at the number `8.99` as defined by the type in different locales.

- Sweden: `8,99 usd`
- Spain: `8.99 USD`
- US: `USD 8.99`
- France: `USD 8,99`

Even though the differences are slight, it can be very important when creating a storefront that works as desired in many different locales.

Formatting numbers as human-readable strings is something we want to rely on the system for, especially when dealing with user locale. Casting a `Double` as a `String` may seem trivial, but formatting the value into the _correct_ string is much more difficult than it appears.

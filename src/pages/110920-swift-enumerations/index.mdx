An enumeration defines a common type for a group of related values and enables you to work with those values in a type-safe way within your code.

<!--more-->

- _Creating an enum:_ You can declare an enum like this in swift

```Swift
enum TimePeriod {
	case morning
	case noon
	case afternoon
	case night
}
```

The name of this enum is "TimePeriod" and it has four cases: `morning`, `noon`, `afternoon`, and `night`.

Enumerations, or `enum`s can also be declared in a single line, like this:

```Swift
enum TimePeriod {
	case morning, noon, afternoon, night
}
```

- _enum type:_ When we define an enum, it defines itself as a new type in Swift. New variables of that type can be declared like this:

```Swift
var presentTime = TimePeriod.morning
print(presentType) // morning
```

`presentTime` variable is of type `TimePeriod`, and we can set the value using the `.` operation.

```Swift
presentTime = .noon
presentTime = .afternoon
presentTime = .night
```

- _Matching enum value:_ The Swift `switch` statement is a simple and straightforward solution for matching the enum value.

```Swift
switch presentTime {
	case .morning:
		print("Foggy morning")
	case .noon:
		print("Sunny noon")
	case .afternoon:
		print("Cloudy afternoon")
	case .night:
		print("Rainy night")
}
```

- _Iterate enum cases:_ To iterator over the cases in an enumeration, we declare it with the `CaseIterable` type.

```Swift
enum TimePeriod: CaseIterable {
	case morning
	case noon
	case afternoon
	case night
}
```

Now we can iterate over all the cases.

```Swift
let numberOfChoices = TimePeriod.allCases.count
print("\(numberOfChoices) choices available")

for timeperiod in TimePeriod.allCases {
	print(timeperiod)
}
```

- _Raw value:_ Each case can provide a `rawValue`. It can be implicit and explicit. We must provide the type in the declaration of the enumeration.

```Swift
enum Institute: Int {
	case school
	case college
	case university
}
```

`Institute` will be of `Int` type raw value for every case. It can be any type in Swift. In this case the value for `school` is 0, and so on.

Raw values for every case can be checked like this:

```Swift
print(Institute.school.rawValue) 			// 0
print(Institute.college.rawValue)			// 1
print(Institute.university.rawValue)		// 2
```

You can also provide explicit raw values for every case if you want.

```Swift
enum Institute: Int {
	case school = 10
	case college = 12
	case university = 14
|
```

- _Associate values with enum cases:_ Sometimes you want to set values with cases. We can also assign tuple values for cases as that enum type. Here we define a variable `sampleArea` as an enum with a value of `Area.square` with an associated tuple value of 10 and 15.

```Swift
enum Area {
	case square(Double, Double)
	case cube(Double, Double, Double)
}

var sampleArea = Area.square(10, 15)
```

Here we can match the enum value with a switch statement. This time we have some assocated values with every enum case. Those values can be extracted as variables or constants for use inside the switch statment.

```Swift
switch sampleArea {
	case .square(let height, let width):
		print("Square of: \(height), \(width).")
	case .cube(let height, let width, let length):
		print("Square of: \(height), \(width), \(length)")
}
```

If associated values are constant or variable, we can simply place `var` or `let` before the case name.

```Swift
switch sampleArea {
	case let .square(height, width):
		print("Square of: \(height), \(width).")
	case let cube(height, width, length):
		print("Square of: \(height), \(width), \(length)")
}
```

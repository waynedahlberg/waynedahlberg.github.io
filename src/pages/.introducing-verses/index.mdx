The year 2020 has really thrown a wrench into all our lifestyles. Here at home, and around the world, the LDS Church has cancelled Sunday services due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the great resources the Church has provided for home-centered learning, I wanted a convenient way to keep up with my daily reading of _The Book of Mormon_.

The Church's official app [Gospel Library](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gospel-library/id598329798) is a massive resource. It has everything you need for gospel study and lesson preparation. In my opinion, its sheer size makes it feel a bit heavy for daily scripture reading. I want to open my phone and start reading where I left off the day before. No footnotes, cross-references, chapter headings. Nothing but scripture verses â€” one at a time on screen.

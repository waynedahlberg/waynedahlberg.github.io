I read yesterday a post by a metallurgist in the Astromech forum. He said the best way to polish billet is to avoid sanding and removing material, just use some Mothers Billet Metal Polish. You put a small amount on a terry cloth and just rub on the dome until a black residue appears.

Wait about a minute and then wipe the residue clean with a fresh terry cloth. I was skeptical, and the billet polish is not cheap, but Iâ€™m a believer now. Below is a photo of the dome after polishing the left side for less than 2 minutes. I used about a quarter size dab of polish.

This weekend I finished both the inner and outer dome surfacing. Using 400, 600, 1000, 1500, then 2000 grit wet sand papers, followed by two rounds of Mothers Billet Polish. Also I marked all the panels according to the specs from [Astromech.net](http://astromech.net).

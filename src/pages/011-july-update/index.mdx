Waiting for parts is the name of the game at this point. Critical parts suppliers are hit and miss. I’ve been attached to the Tapatalk mobile app to keep tabs on parts runs and availability countdowns.

So far so good. I’ve managed to secure the CS:R aluminum legs from WorrParts, along with the matching diet horseshoes and shims that mount to the upper portion of the outside legs. The booster covers came in from IA Parts, and man they are slick. Off to a good start on the legs. Over the next few months I’ll try to pick up the leg struts, shoulder buttons, and under shoulder details. Relatively smaller parts, but no less expensive for their size.

Still need to find all three ankles and all three feet.

Mounted some of the HP’s with painters tape just to get an idea of how it’s going to look once the parts are attached. Also tried out my first dome drilling and use of the captive studs. Seems pretty straight forward, however, I didn’t like how the captive studs are a little visible even with the outer dome placed on top. Hmm. Will have to do more research.

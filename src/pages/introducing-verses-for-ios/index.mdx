The year 2020 has really thrown a wrench into all our lifestyles. Here at home, and around the world, the LDS Church has all but cancelled Sunday services due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the great resources the Church has provided for home-centered learning, I wanted a convenient way to keep up with my daily reading of _The Book of Mormon_.

The Church's official app [Gospel Library](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gospel-library/id598329798) is a kitchen sink. It has everything you need for gospel study and lesson preparation. In my opinion, the vast resources in the app make it feel heavy for daily scripture reading. I want to open my phone and start reading where I left off the day before. No footnotes, cross-references, chapter headings. Nothing but scripture verses — one at a time on screen.

It includes support for all of Tailwind's coolest features, plus tons of stuff that's even better in Tailwind Play than it is in your editor, like:

- Customizing your Tailwind theme
- Enabling special variants, like `group-hover` or `focus-within`
- Using custom directives in your CSS like `@apply`, `@variants`, and `@responsive`
- Adding plugins like `@tailwindcss/typography`
- Intelligent code completion and linting
- Responsive design mode
- One-click sharing

The code completion even updates the rendered preview in _real-time_, which creates an incredible design workflow in the browser — just navigate through different padding utilities with the arrow keys for example to find the perfect value without ever saving the file or even hitting enter!

Our responsive design mode that lets you fine-tune the viewport while you're working on your design, just like you can in Chrome DevTools. You can even drag the viewport beyond the available space, and the preview area will automatically zoom out, letting you design for larger screens even when you have limited space.

One-click sharing really is just that — you don't even need to create an account. Click "Share" and you've immediately got a link to a snapshot of what you're working on that you can share online.

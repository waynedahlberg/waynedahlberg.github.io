Cutting the fiber optic cables was so tedious. It took a very long time, and the perfectionist in me made it all worse. But wow, what a reward. Placing the last piece was so liberating. You’ve got to follow the color coded pattern to get the optics to line up with the right LED components.

Eventually these will be able to render crude scrolling text, so alignment is key. There is a test pattern you can enable by turning the delay pot all the way counter-clockwise and restarting. See the first image for what the pattern looks like.

Can’t wait to get these installed in the dome. Here's a few more photos:

These parts are laser-cut. They have significant burring, and will need to be first on the to-do list. I’ll need to secure a set of sand paper grits, steel wool, and Brillo pads to clean up the edges all around. Luckily I have some [NEVR-DULL polish](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Eagle-One-Nevr-Dull-5-oz./15125758) from when I cleaned up the pipes on my Triumph. This little droid is going to SHINE.

Get yourself a deburring tool! Don’t know what I would have done without one. Many builders report losing some quantity of blood in the deburring process. But with a deburring tool, it is so slick. Both domes and rings took about 45 minutes total, and now all those jagged laser-cut edges are smooth and soft to the touch, and I’m able to grip any part of the dome for the next phase of sanding and polishing.
